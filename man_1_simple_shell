.SH NAME
.B shell - command interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ./hsh

.SS Syntax
The shell interpreter works by executing commands entered by the user. The syntax for shell commands is as follows:

.B #cisfun$
.I <command> <options or flags> <argument 1> <argument 2> ...

.SH DESCRIPTION

This is a simple UNIX command interpreter. Simple_shell is a sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes commands read from standard input or a file.

.SS Overview
A Unix shell is a command-line interpreter that provides a command-line user interface for Unix-like operating systems. The shell is both an interactive command language and a scripting language, used by the operating system to control system execution through shell scripts.

.SS Path Searching
When entering a command, the shell first checks if it has a built-in command of that name. If a match is found in the PATH of the environment variable (env), then the prompt's command is added to the PATH directory and the full path is returned. If no match is found, an error is displayed.

.SH COMPILATION
All files will be compiled with gcc flags

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh

.SH RETURN VALUE
The shell returns zero (0), unless an exit code is specified.

.SH EXAMPLE
